2. In Solution Explorer, you will see a number of projects. Right-click the one that has the same name as the Flutter app and choose `Set as Startup Project`.

3. To generate the necessary dependencies, run `Build > Build Solution` in Visual Studio.

   - You can also press `Ctrl + Shift + B`.
   
   - To run the Windows app from Visual Studio, go to `Debug > Start Debugging`.
   
   - You can also press `F5`.

4. Use the toolbar to switch between Debug and Release configurations as appropriate.

# Steps to Viewing the code:

To view and navigate through Dart programs in  Flutter application, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Open the IDE
Launch the preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports Flutter and Dart. Common choices are Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code with the Flutter and Dart extensions installed.

## Step 2: Open the Project
Open the project by navigating to `File > Open` in the IDE, then browse to the Flutter project's directory and select it.

## Step 3: Navigate to the 'lib' Directory
In the project explorer within the IDE, find the `lib` folder. This is the primary directory where the Dart code for the Flutter project resides.

## Step 4: View Dart Files
Locate `.dart` files within the `lib` folder. These files contain the Dart programs. Double-click on a `.dart` file to open and view it in the editor.

## Step 5: Examine the Code
You can now read Dart code. The `main.dart` file is typically the starting point of the Flutter application, so it's a good file to open first.
